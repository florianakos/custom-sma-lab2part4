### Compile & Execute

Export the java class files into an executable JAR file (how-to [link](https://www.pegaxchange.com/2018/01/11/export-a-java-project-in-eclipse-neon/)).

Afterwards open two terminals and use the following syntax to run the JAR twice, onece for the service and once for the client connecting to it.

```
java -cp {path_to_JAR} {package_name}.{ClassName} [additional arguments if any]
```
